# Rai

Jai made in Rust, well, at least thats the goal :^)

## Why?
Since Jai is a closed-beta, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, I decided to make a clone of it in Rust.
I'm not sure if I'll ever finish it, but I'm having fun making it, so why not?

## ðŸš§ Progress ðŸš§
- [x] Lexer // well, kinda
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Type Checker
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Codegen (to C++)

## Q/A

Q: **Will this be a 1:1 clone of Jai?**
A: *While that is the goal, I'm not sure that I can compete with the Jai team... so I'll probably just make a subset of Jai.*

Q: **Why Rust?**
A: *ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€*
